<h1>Purpose:</h1><br>
I made this script to prank my friend into playing a girl moaning at the max volume. If he closes the script, Loopback will also be turned on which will cause the moans to reverberate. 

I will edit the file and include his reaction when I can get him to execute this script.

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<br>
Would work on most Linux systems. Uses PulseAudio Audio Driver Interface commands and bash.
